    <div class="lyrics-container" id="lyrics">
      <p>When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall</p>
<p>But when she put it in her mouth she can't seem to reach my</p>
<p>Ballin' ain't an issue for me, I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week</p>
<p>Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing</p>
<p>And I'll admit baby, I'm a little camera shy</p>
<p>But exceptions can be made baby, cause you're too damn fly</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show</p>
<p>Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures</p>
<p>You gon' have to take your ass home</p>

<p>Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off</p>
<p>Go 'head girl, strip it down, close your mouth</p>
<p>I just wanna hear your body talk</p>

<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>Oh girl, don't hold back, let it out</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>Oh girl, don't hold back, let it out</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>Don't hold back, let it out</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>Don't hold back</p>

<p>You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free</p>
<p>You gotta pay with your body</p>
<p>Not really into kisses leading into nothing</p>
<p>I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right</p>
<p>I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour</p>
<p>Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl</p>
<p>Until they book a show in NYC</p>
<p>Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep</p>
<p>Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion</p>
<p>Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'</p>
<p>And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'</p>
<p>Said I'm two days strong</p>
<p>And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'</p>

<p>Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off</p>
<p>Go 'head girl, strip it down, close your mouth</p>
<p>I just wanna hear your body talk</p>

<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>Oh girl, don't hold back, let it out</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>Oh girl, don't hold back, let it out</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>Don't hold back, let it out</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>(Nothing is going to change my love for you)</p>
<p>Don't hold back</p>

<p>I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year</p>
<p>I can't remember how it looks inside</p>
<p>So you can picture how my life's been</p>
<p>I went from starin' at the same four walls for twenty-one years</p>
<p>To seein' the whole world in just twelve months</p>
<p>Been gone for so long I might've just found God</p>
<p>Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up and</p>
<p>Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'</p>
<p>And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls</p>
<p>Only bitches down to fuck when you show 'em they're ones and</p>
<p>Probably not if my niggas round them up and</p>
<p>Probably not if we take 'em to my spot</p>
<p>Probably not if I tweak all day, just to sleep at night</p>
<p>God damn I'm high, my doctor told me to stop</p>
<p>And he gave me something to pop</p>
<p>And I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top</p>
<p>And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot</p>
<p>I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?</p>
<p>All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke</p>
<p>Last week was my rough week, I'm still drippin' down from my nose</p>
<p>And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high</p>
<p>But If he goes under that one-ten, believe my driver get fired</p>
<p>And I ain't got any friends</p>
<p>I got XO in my bloodwork and I'm posted up down in Florida</p>
<p>Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA</p>
<p>Sip cold drinks with Grand Marnier</p>
<p>To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk</p>
<p>White Russian when the sun hits</p>
<p>White Russians with tongue tricks</p>
<p>I like the feeling of tongue rings</p>
<p>She like the way my whole tongue flip</p>
<p>She grind hard for tuition</p>
<p>She grind hard 'til her teeth chip</p>
<p>I make her hide it with gold grills</p>
<p>I make her suck it with gold grills</p>
<p>In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep</p>
<p>This ain't nothing to relate to</p>
<p>This ain't nothing to relate to</p>
<p>This ain't nothing to relate to</p>
<p>This ain't nothing to relate to</p>
<p>Even if you tried</p>
<p>You tried, you tried</p>
<p>And you tried</p>
<p>You tried, you tried</p>
<p>And you tried</p>
<p>You tried, you tried</p>
<p>And you tried</p>
<p>You tried</p>
<p>This ain't nothing to relate to</p>
<p>This ain't nothing to relate to</p>
<p>This ain't nothing to relate to</p>
<p>This ain't nothing to relate to</p>
<p>Even if you tried</p>
<p>You tried, you tried</p>
<p>And you tried</p>
<p>You tried, you tried</p>
<p>And you tried</p>
<p>You tried, you tried</p>
<p>And you tried</p>
<p>You tried, oh yeah</p>
